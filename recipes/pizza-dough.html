            <h2>The Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Makes about 4 small pizzas or 2 Lg </h3>
            <h3>Double or even triple the recipe </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (200 grams) flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 cup lukewarm water, plus 1 or 2 tablespoons more as needed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        </body>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Stir dry ingredients,<em>including yeast</em> together in a large bowl. 
                    Add water and olive oil, stirring mixture into as close to a ball as you can.</li>
                <li>Dump all clumps and floury bits onto a lightly floured surface and knead everything into a homogeneous ball.</li>
                <h4>TIP:</h4> <p>If you are finding this step tricky, PAUSE! 
                    <em>Pick a song, crack a beer, feed your cat.</em>
                    Leave the dough for 2-5 mins and then come back to it.
                </p>
                <li>Knead it for just a minute or two.</li>
                <li>Lightly oil the bowl and dump the dough in. Make sure all sides are covered with oil.
                    Cover with plastic wrap and leave untouched for an hour or two.</li>
                    <h4>You are looking for the dough to <stron>double</stron> in size</h4>
                <li>Dump it back on the floured counter (yup, I leave mine messy), and gently press the air out of the dough.
                  Fold the piece into a ball shape, and let it sit under that plastic wrap for <strong>20</strong>minutes.</li>
                  <li>Sprinkle pizza stone or baking sheet with cornmeal and preheat oven to 450C</li>
                  <li>Roll out pizza (do the spin and toss special if you're daring) and decorate your pizza with whatever toppings you like</li>
                  <li>Bake for about 10 mins</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <h4>Freeze Leftover Pizza for easy weekday meals</h4>
